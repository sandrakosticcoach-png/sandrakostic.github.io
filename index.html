The Journey
Why Listen to Me?
For 20+ years, I sat on the other side of the table.
As Head of Talent Acquisition at Fortune 500 companies like Holcim, NCR, and Adecco, I interviewed thousands of professionals. I saw the patterns: the burnout hiding behind polished resumes, the identity crises masked as "seeking new opportunities," the leaders struggling with impostor syndrome.

I understood the corporate game from the inside. But I also saw what it cost people.

Now, as a psychologist and Certified Analytic-Network Coach, I help professionals navigate the challenges I witnessed repeatedly in corporate life.

I bring both worlds together: the strategic insight of a corporate executive and the psychological depth to understand what's really happening beneath the surface.
